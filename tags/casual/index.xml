      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about algorithmic art, which is a visual art genre that uses an algorithm (usually coded on a computer) to draw interesting or evocative images. While it is possible to do this in many languages, I decided to delve into the Processing language, which is a Java-style language and development environment that is specialised for visualisation.
What is this? This is an early casual output of that exploration.</description>
