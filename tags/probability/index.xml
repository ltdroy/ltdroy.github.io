      <description>The ProblemIn the main game of the National Lottery (Lotto), the chance that one ticket wins a share of the Jackpot is 1 in 13,983,816.
Susie plans to buy 100 tickets with different numbers in each draw until she wins a Jackpot share. There are two draws per week.
Which of the following is closest to the time she can expect to wait until she wins a Jackpot share?</description>

      <description>Theorem\[y = x + \epsilon\]
Where \(x\) and \(\epsilon\) are random independent variables and \(\epsilon\) has an expected value of 0.
\[\implies \rho_{x,y} = \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2} }\]
Where \(\rho_{x,y}\) is the Pearson product moment correlation between \(x\) and \(y\), and \(\sigma_x\) is the standard deviation of \(x\), etc.
ProofTo prove this we rely on the following previously established theorems regarding the properties of the expected value operator (\(E[\cdot]\)), the definition of variance of a random variable in terms of expected value, and the definition of the Pearson correlation.</description>
